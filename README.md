# cs203-S2019-sheets

This repository contains all of the assignment sheets for Computer Science 203
Spring 2019. Each directory in this repository contains the LaTeX source code for
a assignment designed for use with [GitHub
Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). To learn more about the course in
which these assignments were completed, please visit the [Computer Science 203
Spring 2019 GitHub
Organization](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-203-S2019). All of
the LaTeX files in this repository are automatically compiled with [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/), thus ensuring that they compile correctly and,
moreover, that a PDF of each assignment is available in the GitHub repository
whenever a commit is tagged for a release.

## Accessing the Assignments

Since this repository primarily contains LaTeX source code, the Travis CI
configuration for it will compile the source code and automatically release a
PDF of the source code whenever the last commit is associated with a [Git
Tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). As such, this will
cause a PDF file to become available in the listing of
the [Releases](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-203-S2019/cs203-S2019-labs/releases)
for this repository. All release numbers in this repository adhere to the
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) standard.

## Problems or Praise

If you have any problems with compiling or using these laboratory assignment
sheets, then please create an issue in this repository using the "Issues" link
at the top of this site. Please note that these assignment sheets have been
developed and tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 workstation running a recent version of
LaTeX that was manually installed using the TeXLive installer. It is also worth
noting that you can also compile any of the assignment sheets using LaTeX
development tools such as `latexmk`. If you are unable to compile an assignment
sheet with your development tools and your execution environment, then please
open a new issue and we will attempt to resolve your concerns.
